## 🏁 Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- A [Google AI API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/track-master.git
    cd track-master
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    
    The AI features in this project use Google's Genkit, which requires an API key for Google AI.
    
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

4.  **Run the development servers:**

    You need to run two processes simultaneously: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit backend.

    *   **Terminal 1: Start the Next.js Frontend**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The application will be running at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

    *   **Terminal 2: Start the Genkit Backend**
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:watch
        ```
        This command starts the Genkit development UI, where you can inspect your AI flows. It typically runs on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

Now, both your frontend and backend are running. The frontend will automatically connect to the Genkit backend to power the AI features.

## 📁 Project Structure
