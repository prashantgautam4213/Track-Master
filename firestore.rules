/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Train Ticket Reservation System.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model where users can only manage their own data (bookings) unless they are administrators.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only to the user and admins.
 * - /trains/{trainId}: Stores train details, publicly readable, but write access is restricted to admins.
 * - /stations/{stationId}: Stores station information, publicly readable, write access is not allowed.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Stores booking information for a specific user, accessible only to the user and admins.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Presence of a document grants admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users cannot list all users in the /users collection.
 * - Stations collection is read-only and only writeable by admins (currently disabled)
 * - Train creation, update, and deletion are restricted to admins.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` is part of the `bookings` document path, which makes it straightforward to enforce ownership.
