/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Train Ticket Reservation System
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and bookings,
 * and an admin-only model for managing trains. Stations are publicly readable.
 * Admin privileges are granted by the existence of a document in the `roles_admin` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile information, accessible only to the user.
 * - /trains/{trainId}: Stores train details, publicly readable, but writeable only by admins.
 * - /stations/{stationId}: Stores station information, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Stores booking information, accessible only to the user.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Presence of a document grants admin privileges to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profiles and bookings.
 * - Trains can only be managed by admins.
 * - Stations are publicly readable.
 * - Listing of user documents is denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is part of the `/users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}` path, enabling path-based authorization without additional `get()` calls.
